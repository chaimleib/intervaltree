intervaltree: A mutable, self-balancing interval tree for Python.
Queries may be by point, by range overlap, or by range envelopment.

Test module: IntervalTree, remove_overlap caused incorrect balancing
where intervals overlapping an ancestor's x_center were buried too deep.
Submitted as issue #72 (KeyError raised after calling remove_overlap)
