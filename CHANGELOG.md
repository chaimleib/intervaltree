Change log
==========

Version 2.1.0
-------------
- Added:
    - `merge_overlaps()` method and tests
    - `merge_equals()` method and tests
    - `range()` method
    - `span()` method, for returning the difference between `end()` and `begin()`
    - `search()` method now has an optional `data` parameter, an iterable of data which filters down the search result
- Fixes:
    - Development version numbering is changing to be compliant with PEP440. Version numbering now contains major, minor and micro release numbers, plus the number of builds following the stable release version, e.g. 2.0.4b34
    - Speed improvement: `begin()` and `end()` methods used iterative `min()` and `max()` builtins instead of the more efficient `iloc` member available to `SortedDict`
    - `overlaps()` method used to return `True` even if provided null test interval
- Maintainers:
    - Added coverage test (`make coverage`) with html report (`htmlcov/index.html`)
    - Tests run slightly faster

Version 2.0.4
-------------
- Fix: Issue #27: README incorrectly showed using a comma instead of a colon when querying the `IntervalTree`: it showed `tree[begin, end]` instead of `tree[begin:end]`

Version 2.0.3
-------------
- Fix: README showed using + operator for setlike union instead of the correct | operator
- Removed tests from release package to speed up installation; to get the tests, download from GitHub

Version 2.0.2
-------------
- Fix: Issue #20: performance enhancement for large trees. `IntervalTree.search()` made a copy of the entire `boundary_table` resulting in linear search time. The `sortedcollections` package is now the sole install dependency

Version 2.0.1
-------------
- Fix: Issue #26: failed to prune empty `Node` after a rotation promoted contents of `s_center`

Version 2.0.0
-------------
- `IntervalTree` now supports the full `collections.MutableSet` API
- Added:
    - `__delitem__` to `IntervalTree`
    - `Interval` comparison methods `lt()`, `gt()`, `le()` and `ge()` to `Interval`, as an alternative to the comparison operators, which are designed for sorting
    - `IntervalTree.from_tuples(iterable)`
    - `IntervalTree.clear()`
    - `IntervalTree.difference(iterable)`
    - `IntervalTree.difference_update(iterable)`
    - `IntervalTree.union(iterable)`
    - `IntervalTree.intersection(iterable)`
    - `IntervalTree.intersection_update(iterable)`
    - `IntervalTree.symmetric_difference(iterable)`
    - `IntervalTree.symmetric_difference_update(iterable)`
    - `IntervalTree.chop(a, b)`
    - `IntervalTree.slice(point)`
- Deprecated `IntervalTree.extend()` -- use `update()` instead
- Internal improvements:
    - More verbose tests with progress bars
    - More tests for comparison and sorting behavior
    - Code in the README is included in the unit tests
- Fixes
    - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: On ranged queries where `begin >= end`, the query operated on the overlaps of `begin`. This behavior was documented as expected in 1.x; it is now changed to be more consistent with the definition of `Interval`s, which are half-open.
    - Issue #25: pruning empty Nodes with staggered descendants could result in invalid trees
    - Sorting `Interval`s and numbers in the same list gathered all the numbers at the beginning and the `Interval`s at the end
    - `IntervalTree.overlaps()` and friends returned `None` instead of `False`
    - Maintainers: `make install-testpypi` failed because the `pip` was missing a `--pre` flag

Version 1.1.1
-------------
- Removed requirement for pyandoc in order to run functionality tests.

Version 1.1.0
-------------
- Added ability to use `Interval.distance_to()` with points, not just `Intervals`
- Added documentation on return types to `IntervalTree` and `Interval`
- `Interval.__cmp__()` works with points too
- Fix: `IntervalTree.score()` returned maximum score of 0.5 instead of 1.0. Now returns max of subscores instead of avg
- Internal improvements:
    - Development version numbering scheme, based on `git describe` the "building towards" release is appended after a hyphen, eg. 1.0.2-37-g2da2ef0-1.10. The previous tagged release is 1.0.2, and there have been 37 commits since then, current tag is g2da2ef0, and we are getting ready for a 1.1.0 release
    - Optimality tests added
    - `Interval` overlap tests for ranges, `Interval`s and points added

Version 1.0.2
-------------
-Bug fixes:
    - `Node.depth_score_helper()` raised `AttributeError`
    - README formatting

Version 1.0.1
-------------
- Fix: pip install failure because of failure to generate README.rst

Version 1.0.0
-------------
- Renamed from PyIntervalTree to intervaltree
- Speed improvements for adding and removing Intervals (~70% faster than 0.4)
- Bug fixes:
    - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE: `len()` of an `Interval` is always 3, reverting to default behavior for `namedtuples`. In Python 3, `len` returning a non-integer raises an exception. Instead, use `Interval.length()`, which returns 0 for null intervals and `end - begin` otherwise. Also, if the `len() === 0`, then `not iv` is `True`.
    - When inserting an `Interval` via `__setitem__` and improper parameters given, all errors were transformed to `IndexError`
    - `split_overlaps` did not update the `boundary_table` counts
- Internal improvements:
    - More robust local testing tools
    - Long series of interdependent tests have been separated into sections

Version 0.4
-------------

- Faster balancing (~80% faster)
- Bug fixes:
    - Double rotations were performed in place of a single rotation when presented an unbalanced Node with a balanced child.
    - During single rotation, kept referencing an unrotated Node instead of the new, rotated one

Version 0.3.3
-------------

- Made IntervalTree crash if inited with a null Interval (end <= begin)
- IntervalTree raises ValueError instead of AssertionError when a null Interval is inserted

Version 0.3.2
-------------

- Support for Python 3.2+ and 2.6+
- Changed license from LGPL to more permissive Apache license
- Merged changes from https://github.com/konstantint/PyIntervalTree to
    https://github.com/chaimleib/PyIntervalTree
    - Interval now inherits from a namedtuple. Benefits: should be faster.
        Drawbacks: slight behavioural change (Intervals not mutable anymore).
    - Added float tests
    - Use setup.py for tests
    - Automatic testing via travis-ci
    - Removed dependency on six
- Interval improvements:
    - Intervals without data have a cleaner string representation
    - Intervals without data are pickled more compactly
    - Better hashing
    - Intervals are ordered by begin, then end, then by data. If data is not
        orderable, sorts by type(data)
- Bug fixes:
    - Fixed crash when querying empty tree
    - Fixed missing close parenthesis in examples
    - Made IntervalTree crash earlier if a null Interval is added
- Internals:
    - New test directory
    - Nicer display of data structures for debugging, using custom
        test/pprint.py (Python 2.6, 2.7)
    - More sensitive exception handling
    - Local script to test in all supported versions of Python
    - Added IntervalTree.score() to measure how optimally a tree is structured

Version 0.2.3
-------------

- Slight changes for inclusion in PyPI.
- Some documentation changes
- Added tests
- Bug fix: interval addition via [] was broken in Python 2.7 (see http://bugs.python.org/issue21785)
- Added intervaltree.bio subpackage, adding some utilities for use in bioinformatics

Version 0.2.2b
--------------

- Forked from https://github.com/MusashiAharon/PyIntervalTree
